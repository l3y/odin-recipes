    <h1>Ramen noodle and broth dish inspired by the Japanese classic using ingredients commonly available in American supermarkets. Quite involved, but it has become one of my family's favorites, especially in cooler weather. Slurping is recommended.</h1>

        <li>
            <p>While broth simmers, fill a saucepan with water. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to a simmer. Lower eggs into the water 1 at a time. Cook 7 minutes for barely set yolks. Remove eggs from hot water, run under cold water until cool, and peel.

            <p>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil in preparation for cooking noodles. Reduce heat to a simmer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Use a slotted spoon or long-handled strainer to remove garlic, ginger, and onion from the broth in the stock pot after it has simmered 40 minutes. Discard vegetables. Add soy sauce, sake, chile sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and salt and stir well.
                Cover stock pot loosely and simmer 10 to 20 minutes more.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Return simmering water to a boil. Add noodles and return to a boil. Cook noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain and divide noodles between 4 large bowls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add shrimp and scallops to the simmering broth. Cook until opaque, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Ladle finished broth into bowls to barely cover noodles. Add equal amounts of shrimp and 1 scallop to the center of each bowl. Place a portion of bean sprouts on the side of each bowl. Place 2 soft-boiled egg halves, yolks up, resting on noodles
                in each bowl; keep eggs above the broth. Garnish each bowl with scallions.</p>
